                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <br> Before getting into AI Art Generators, let’s discuss what Disruptive Technologies are. Breaking it down to its root words, these are technologies that disrupt or cause major changes to the field. Although the connotation of the word disruptive may sound contrary to the very purpose of innovation, technologies and innovations were made to make changes, it just so happens that the changes some innovations changed the rules of the game. All these innovations and technologies are intended to enhance our ways of living by bringing some type of ease in how we would conventionally do certain activities (Kylliäinen, 2019). These innovations and technologies come in different forms, some of the most recent ones we’ve come to know of are the up-and-rising service innovations available online such as the various AI generators (Innolytics, What is Innovation?). <br> <br>
                    </div>
                        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; text-align:justify;" class="">
                            <div style="flex: 33%; padding: 10px;">
                                <h3><br>The rate at which technological advancement occurs typically surpasses the need for high-performance technology</h3>
                                As a result, incumbents may overserve the market by providing more advanced, feature-rich goods than customers require, creating a gap between customer demand and firm performance. This gap allows competitors to fill the void by offering products that better align with customer needs.
                            </div>
                            <div style="flex: 33%; padding: 10px;">
                                <h3><br>There are different types of innovation, including technological and business model innovations</h3>
                                The majority of innovations are sustaining, meaning they improve products and services along performance parameters that mainstream customers care about and that markets have valued over time. These innovations enable incumbents to sell more products to their current customers while maintaining higher margins and profitability. Disruptive innovations, on the other hand, are less common and inferior to incumbent goods on recognized performance parameters. However, they provide a unique blend of attributes that appeal to peripheral customer groups, particularly those towards the bottom of the market. These attributes may include smaller size, lower cost, greater accessibility, or enhanced convenience.
                            </div>
                            <div style="flex: 33%; padding: 10px;">
                                <h3><br>Existing organizations' investments in new innovations are limited by their current customers and established profit models.</h3>
                                As a result, investments that are unappealing to incumbents may be appealing to competitors with few or no customers and fewer competing investment options. Consequently, incumbents are frequently disinclined to develop disruptive innovations that promise lower profits, target smaller markets, and provide inferior products and services that their current customers cannot utilize.

                        </div>
						<br>In conclusion, disruptive innovation is a rare type of innovation that emerges at the bottom of the market and offers a new set of characteristics, distinct from existing innovations at the top of the market. Established organizations generally do not engage in developing disruptive innovations as they are viewed as unnecessary for their existing clients. Importantly, the concept of disruptiveness is relative, as a given innovation may be disruptive to one organization but sustaining to another. 
						<br>
						<br>Innovations are being created and developed everyday permeating different aspects of our lives. Some innovations go right under our noses with how unexpectedly useful they turn out to be, from the simplest gadget accessory such as the monopod to highly advanced AI generators that use machine learning to produce quality outputs. On the topic of AI generators, there has been a rise in the variety of content creating AI recently (Darbinyan, 2022). These content generating AI produce different types of content, from text to art, and most have been made available online for our use (Marcinuk, 2022; Ademi, 2022). With the rise of these AI, particularly art generating AI, professionals in some fields have been worrying about their careers (Pillai, 2022). With the advent of easily produced and efficiently created art, some opt to run to AI instead of human artists. Considering that AI seems to be more efficient in some aspects of work, some fear that they may be favored by businesses (Dey, 2022). But can AI Art Generators with machine learning and loads of data stand a chance against real artists with years of experience and boundless creativity?

                            <p>Digital art is continuously growing as our technology evolves quickly, thanks to new inventions and innovations created and discovered in recent times. One of the most fast-growing and controversial topics is the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically the area of artificial intelligence art or most commonly known as AI art.</p>

                            <div style="flex: 50%; padding: 10px;">
                                According to UNICEF (2021), “AI refers to machine-based systems that can, given a set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions that influence real or virtual environments. AI systems interact with us and act on our environment, either directly or indirectly. Often, they appear to operate autonomously, and can adapt their behavior by learning about the context.” AI-generated art can include fully autonomous works—in which researchers investigate whether AI can be creative without human intervention—and real-time human-robot collaboration. In doing so, they attempt to comprehend human-machine communication. AI is now being fully implemented in various artistic fields, including paintings, poetry, films, and music.
                            </div>
                            <div style="flex: 50%; padding: 10px;">
                                AI art, from the name itself, is a type of art that is procured through the use of artificial intelligence. Although there are a ton of ways to create AI art, one of the most known is through the utilization of a system called “AI Art generators” which would rely on a technique called “generation synthesis.” It operates based on a prompt or algorithms (sequence of simple and complex instructions or rules coded and defined by the person running the process) to extract data and information from analyzing artwork colors, brush strokes, shapes, and any compositional details done by human artists that these generators then would piece them together to create a new piece which is what is known as AI art. 
                            </div>
                        </div>
					<br>
					<p>AI art generators can have indirect effects on a wide range of industries. For instance, the proliferation of AI-generated art could potentially impact industries related to the creation, distribution, and consumption of art, such as the following: traditional art world (e.g. galleries, museums, auction houses), the design industry (e.g. graphics and media, digital product design), the entertainment industry (e.g. movies, television, video games) -- since AI art takes minimal effort than traditional and digital art, their rise is becoming popular even in the gaming industry. AI-generated art can enhance the entire graphics and overall design of video games. Thus some artists and game developers are threatened by AI art because its nature is exploitative since it draws from a vast library of uncredited source images (Gray, 2022). Likewise with the advertising industry (e.g. companies that use art to create visual advertisements), advertisers must take caution as AI generated images and generative ads, produced by AI systems from compositional details and styles of other creators, could be easily commercialized without giving proper credit. </p>

In 2011, a paper was written describing the process of digitally restoring Fernando Amorsolo’s painting named “Malacañang by the River” through a neural network (Palmero & Soriano, 2011). At present, Philippine artists have divided views on AI-generated art. While there are those that see AI as something that can be abused and monopolized in the art industry, there are also others that see it as a fascinating and useful product of technology (de Leon, 2022)."</p>

                            <p>AI art generators are disruptive in the market due to their potential to generate art that is indiscernible from human-created art. This could potentially result in a shift in the valuation of art and create new opportunities for artists who are able to produce high-quality AI-generated art.</p>

                                <h2>Positive</h2>
                                <br>Artificial intelligence (AI) art generators can be both seen as something useful and harmful to the art industry. Starting with its positive impacts, AI art generators can help in the draft or planning process of an artist. It can help conceptualize an idea in your mind, and can help you visualize it before working on the actual artwork. Gey (2021) argues that artificial intelligence won’t be replacing the artists themselves, but will only serve as an additional tool that can aid them in creating their artworks. He notes that many critics see AI as something that will positively disrupt the art industry, as “it enables artists to express themselves more easily.” Further elaborating on this viewpoint, he believes that if artists used AI, it can speed up their process of creating art and in turn, the quicker process can give them more profit in the long run.
                                <br><br>Artists are often faced with the challenge of making a variety of changes to their work. This can include things like adding color, changing the focal point, or even re-focusing their image. AI can help by automating this process so that artists only have to make a few clicks before seeing the results of their changes. This is particularly useful when it comes to artworks that are very complex and require a lot of time and effort.
				<br><br>AI can also add more personalization to the user experience. AI has the ability to collect and analyze massive amounts of data in order to provide an individualized interface that is tailored to your needs and preferences (e.g. layouts, fonts, colors, content, and suggestions). This type of toolset would give artists more options to cater to their customers’ needs by allowing them to implement features that may not be possible with conventional techniques.
				<br><br>Some AI art generators like DALL-E 2, which is an AI image generator developed by OpenAI, can create highly realistic images with its easy-to-use interface. With its easy-to-use interface, it allows artists of all levels to make highly realistic images. It’s great for professional artists, but also makes it viable for hobbyists to do some creative work on their own. DALL-E 2 offers the paintbrush tool that enables you to apply specific details to your image, like shadows and highlights.The paintbrush also allows you to add multiple layers with different properties for each layer, so that you can customize parts of the image however you choose.
				<br><br>Gey (2021) also points out another usage for AI art generators: art restoration. AI art generators can function and produce works by analyzing an incredibly large number of multimedia from their databases (Clarke, 2022). In the field of art restoration, old artworks by famous artists can be restored in a quicker and more accurate manner. A notable example where AI was utilized in the restoration of a famous artwork was with Rembrandt’s “Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq” also known as “The Night Watch”. In Escalante-De Mattei’s (2021) report on the subject matter, the museum that currently holds “The Night Watch”, The Rijksmuseum, has made multiple attempts to restore the artwork. On their 26th attempt, they turned to artificial intelligence to help recreate the missing segments of the mutilated painting. The “restored” version made with help from AI was soon printed and varnished, and then was displayed in the museum for three months.

                                <h2>Negative</h2>
                                <br>With the rising popularity of accessible online artificial intelligence (AI) art generators, it has exposed more people to the idea of AI art. Although this may be a great way to have assistance with visualizing creative ideas, other people have specifically chosen to use these art generators with ill-mannered intentions. An app currently trending online, “Lensa AI,” has produced some eye-catching creations. With such distinct and interesting results coming from the application, many artists are wondering how and where is it getting “training” from? Hatmaker (2022) states that the main AI generator that runs the Lensa AI app is called “Stable Diffusion.” This software has studied more than a total of 2.3 billion images. With this huge number of media, many personal photos and artworks taken from a variety of websites have been used in the training of the AI. Whether or not they have consented to this, artists and creatives do not have the choice to have their works removed from this system.
                                <br><br>A more specific instance that showcases the negative effects of AI art generators was when an artist named “AT” (@haruno_intro) got their artwork stolen by a self-proclaimed AI “artist” named “Musaish” (@musaishh). Jiang (2022) further discussed this situation in an in-depth report: AT was live-streaming themselves digitally painting on Twitch, wherein Musaish simply took a screenshot of the almost-finished piece, inputted it into an AI art generator to help “finish” the artwork, and quickly posted it to their Twitter account many hours before AT was able to officially post the finished original artwork. Many people, along with the original artist, were soon alerted of this problem when Musaish started complaining and accusing AT of “stealing” their art, arguing that since they posted it first, AT should give them credit. Many Twitter users and artists got upset and angry over Musaish’s baseless accusations, and Mushaish deleted their account soon after. 
				<br><br>A comparison of the two artworks are shown below: (On the left) The original fanart drawn by AT (@haruno_intro), that AI artist Musaish (@musaishh) stole from. (On the right) After screenshotting and stealing the unfinished artwork of AT (@haruno_intro), Musaish (@musaishh) used NovelAI to finish the incomplete screenshot.

				<br><br>Artists are forced to put thoughts, feelings and individual experiences into the piece, meanwhile the emotional depth of an AI art piece can be more than just a catchy tagline which is then thrown behind an algorithm to get the job done. While there are certainly benefits to machine-generated content, some people view it as lacking the human touch that makes art so engaging. It is that difference which separates a machine from being able to create anything even close to what you may find from a human artist.
				<br><br>Content generated by artificial intelligence is based on existing data and facts, meaning it lacks the creativity and freshness that can only be achieved by human minds. Because of that, AI generated content can lack common sense and human nuances. For example, AI can’t see or understand lines, circles, squares, color, texture because it simply knows them from scientific information fed to it by humans (CrewMachine, 2017).
				<br><br>AI content helps create efficient content that can be personalized for different audiences at lightning speed in the best possible way, but it's still not on par with humans in terms of creativity. The role of AI is still very much one of an aid rather than a replacement for human creativity.
				<br><br>The many issues with artificial intelligence (AI) art generators have made artists worried for the future of art and creative work. These AI art generators have the power to aid people in various ways, but this usefulness is quickly overshadowed by the people using these programs with selfish and malicious intent.

                            <div class="separator"><span><i class="fa fa-square"></i></span></div>
                            <div class="spacer-single"></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                        
                        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; text-align:justify;">
                            <div style="flex: 50%; padding: 10px;">
                                AI art generators can have indirect effects on a wide range of industries. For instance, the proliferation of AI-generated art could potentially impact industries related to the creation, distribution, and consumption of art, such as the following: traditional art world (e.g. galleries, museums, auction houses), the design industry (e.g. graphics and media, digital product design), the entertainment industry (e.g. movies, television, video games) -- since AI art takes minimal effort than traditional and digital art, their rise is becoming popular even in the gaming industry. AI-generated art can enhance the entire graphics and overall design of video games. Thus some artists and game developers are threatened by AI art because its nature is exploitative since it draws from a vast library of uncredited source images (Gray, 2022). Likewise with the advertising industry (e.g. companies that use art to create visual advertisements), advertisers should take caution as AI generated images and generative ads, produced by AI systems from compositional details and styles of other creators, could be easily commercialized without giving proper credit.

                            <div style="flex: 50%; padding: 10px;">
                                Although, some ad agencies do benefit from these art generators as cost-effective and time-saving tools when conceptualizing and making mood boards for their clients, instead of gathering stock images from search engines for hours (Bonila, 2022). These industries (i.e. design, entertainment, advertising), however, also have another issue to keep in mind when using AI generators and that is the demographic representation (e.g. gender, race, age) found in resulting images. As images and art are manually fed and trained into the AI system based on keywords, critics are concerned that generated art would reflect human bias and stereotypes (Wong, 2022). Furthermore, AI art generators could also indirectly affect industries related to the underlying technology, such as the computer hardware and software industries, similar to those involved in developing and training AI systems, such as academia and research institutions.

									<span class="title">Disruptive technology introduces new systems and business models to the market.</span>
									Disruptive Technology shakes up the current market and paves the path for innovation. It becomes the impetus to the ever-growing market, changing up how the market usually operates by introducing new systems and business models. A prime example of this are the AI systems.  As A.I. becomes more intelligent, sophisticated, and human-like, it is easy to worry and fear the changes it will bring to humanity.

									<span class="title">AI systems can be both useful and threatening.</span>
                                    We naturally tend to fear the unknown, as this is supposed to protect us from what is coming, but there are always two sides of the same coin. On the one hand, art generators are useful for casual users. People who never knew they can make “art”, now can. That being said, it is fulfilling its intended purpose, which is to help us improve our work, and save money and time. On the other hand, it poses a great threat, especially in terms of job security to many artists.

									<span class="title">The issue of job automation and intellectual property theft is a concern.</span>
                                    Job automation and intellectual property theft are the most pressing concerns. Recent events concerning “Lensa, AI” highlighted these points of interest. Some were fascinated by how well this A.I. works, while many were concerned about the hyper-real images seen as art and how they can be used incorrectly to deceive people and spread misinformation. The only way to reduce the risk is to have a regulating body that remains to be seen and improved on.

									<span class="title">Changes brought about by AI art are a part of the modern world.</span>
                                    Another area of concern is whether or not A.I.-generated art is real art or not. Currently, there’s still no universal definition of what art is, but one thing is certain– art is a product of human creativity. There are many opposing ideas regarding the concept of AI art as art and many different points of view came to light. Nevertheless, art generators are disruptive, and their practical and long-term ramifications are yet to be seen.

									<span class="title">Supporting local artists is important as the world adjusts to AI art.</span>
                                    Regardless of its negative or positive effects, A.I. Art is now part of our modern digital world, and as citizens of this world, it is important to recognize that changes are happening. It is essential to learn how to take advantage of these tools, but not at the cost of endangering the people’s livelihood. As the world adjusts its rules to cater A.I. art, we can meanwhile support our local artists whenever we can. Some of them are Cazzyflores, 88valentine, Rcehb.art, Kevin Eric Raymundo, Cold.crest, and Beamatuts_artdump.
