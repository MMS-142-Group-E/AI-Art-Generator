-- Part 1: EXTENDED DEFINITION OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY --
Disruptive Technology; an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries, or businesses operate. A disruptive technology sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces because it has attributes that are recognizably superior (Smith, 2022).

Breaking it down to its root words, it is a kind of technology that disrupts or causes major changes to the setting. Although the connotation of the word disruptive may sound contrary to the very purpose of innovation, technologies and innovations were made to make changes, it just so happens that the changes some innovations changed the rules of the game. 
All these innovations and technologies are intended to enhance our ways of living by bringing some type of ease in how we would conventionally do certain activities (Kylliäinen, 2019). These innovations and technologies come in different forms, some of the most recent ones we’ve come to know of are the up-and-rising service innovations available online such as the various AI generators (Innolytics, What is Innovation?).

In his 1997 model, Christensen inferred three principal components of disruptive innovation:

(1) The rate at which technological advancement occurs typically surpasses the need for high-performance technology. 
As a result, incumbents may overserve the market by providing more advanced, feature-rich goods than customers require, creating a gap between customer demand and firm performance. This gap allows competitors to fill the void by offering products that better align with customer needs.

(2) There are different types of innovation, including technological and business model innovations. 
The majority of innovations are sustaining, meaning they improve products and services along performance parameters that mainstream customers care about and that markets have valued over time. These innovations enable incumbents to sell more products to their current customers while maintaining higher margins and profitability. Disruptive innovations, on the other hand, are less common and inferior to incumbent goods on recognized performance parameters. However, they provide a unique blend of attributes that appeal to peripheral customer groups, particularly those towards the bottom of the market. These attributes may include smaller size, lower cost, greater accessibility, or enhanced convenience.

(3) Existing organizations' investments in new innovations are limited by their current customers and established profit models. 
As a result, investments that are unappealing to incumbents may be appealing to competitors with few or no customers and fewer competing investment options. Consequently, incumbents are frequently disinclined to develop disruptive innovations that promise lower profits, target smaller markets, and provide inferior products and services that their current customers cannot utilize.
In conclusion, disruptive innovation is a rare type of innovation that emerges at the bottom of the market and offers a new set of characteristics, distinct from existing innovations at the top of the market. Established organizations generally do not engage in developing disruptive innovations as they are viewed as unnecessary for their existing clients. Importantly, the concept of disruptiveness is relative, as a given innovation may be disruptive to one organization but sustaining to another.



-- Part 2: WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ART GENERATION / HOW DOES IT WORK --

Digital art is continuously growing as our technology evolves quickly, thanks to new inventions and innovations created and discovered in recent times.
One of the most fast-growing and controversial topics is the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically the area of artificial intelligence art or most commonly known as AI art.
According to UNICEF (2021), “AI refers to machine-based systems that can, given a set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions that influence real or virtual environments. 
AI systems interact with us and act on our environment, either directly or indirectly. Often, they appear to operate autonomously, and can adapt their behavior by learning about the context.” 
AI-generated art can include fully autonomous works—in which researchers investigate whether AI can be creative without human intervention—and real-time human-robot collaboration. 
In doing so, they attempt to comprehend human-machine communication. AI is now being fully implemented in various artistic fields, including paintings, poetry, films, and music.

AI art, from the name itself, is a type of art that is procured through the use of artificial intelligence. 
Although there are a ton of ways to create AI art, one of the most known is through the utilization of a system called “AI Art generators” which would rely on a technique called “generation synthesis.” 
It operates based on a prompt or algorithms (sequence of simple and complex instructions or rules coded and defined by the person running the process) to extract data and information from analyzing artwork colors, brush strokes, shapes, and any compositional details done by human artists that these generators then would piece them together to create a new piece which is what is known as AI art. 


-- Part 3: BRIEF HISTORY AND CURRENT SITUATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ART GENERATION --

There is no single event that led to the development of AI art generators. Instead, the development of AI art generators has been the result of a series of technological and conceptual advancements in the field of artificial intelligence. Below is a brief history of AI-generated art from the 1950s to the present day:

1950s

In the mid-1950s, John McCarthy, also recognized as the Father of Artificial Intelligence (AI), coined AI and defined it as the “science and engineering of making intelligent machines” (Artificial Solutions, 2020). But in addition to making human intelligence the standard for improving AI, human creativity was soon added. AI has then been utilized as a medium for creating art for several years. 

One early example of AI-generated art can be traced back to the 1950s when a computer program called "traveling salesperson" was utilized to generate drawings of abstract shapes and lines to produce simple geometric patterns (Scott, 2022). 

The development of the first artificial neural networks in the 1950s provided a computational model for learning and decision-making inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. But at the time, the technology available for creating and running computer programs was limited, resulting in artworks that were still simple. Nevertheless, these early experiments with AI art established the foundation for more sophisticated AI art generators that would be developed in the following decades. 

1960s to 2000s

The advent of powerful computers in the 1960s allowed researchers to train and evaluate complex artificial neural networks on large datasets.
The ‘60s and ‘70s were the times AI researchers utilized computer programs for creating more complex art, such as drawings of human faces and landscapes. These early AI art generators were restricted by the technology of the time, resulting in art that was often simplistic and lacked subtlety (Anyoha, 2020).
In the 1980s, the introduction of deep learning algorithms enabled artificial neural networks to learn multiple levels of abstraction in data and improve their performance on complex tasks (Yang & Yang, 2014).

During the ‘80s and ‘90s, AI art generators began to evolve, taking advantage of advances in computer hardware and software. These new AI art generators were capable of producing more sophisticated and detailed art, some of which were even exhibited in galleries. A well-known example of AI-generated art in 1999 is the "Electric Sheep screensaver" which employed AI algorithms to generate a sequence of abstract images displayed on computers running the screensaver (Diaz-Aviles, 2019). 

2000s to Present
The availability of large amounts of data and computing power in the 21st century has allowed researchers to train and develop highly advanced AI models that can generate art and other creative outputs. With this came the rise of generative models which are a class of AI algorithms designed to generate new data similar to a given input (Karpathy, 2020). These generative models were used to create a wide range of AI-generated art, including images, music, and even poetry. A notable example of an AI-art generator from the year 2005 is the "Painting Fool" program which utilized AI algorithms to combine elements from different source images and apply different artistic techniques in painting (The Guardian, 2012). 
In recent years, AI art generators have undergone significant advancements, primarily due to the development of deep learning algorithms and the abundance of data. These advancements have enabled them to generate art that is indiscernible from human-created art. Currently, AI art generators are utilized in a diverse range of applications, including the creation of digital paintings and sculptures, as well as the generation of music and writing. 

Current Situation in the Philippines
According to Microsoft Philippines, the year of AI in the country is 2018 (Rosales et al., 2020). During this time, AI was also expected to significantly improve creativity and productivity in the market. When it came to AI and Philippine Literature, one of the known milestones was the introduction of a robot that could photograph people and make them Filipino poems (The Good News Pilipinas Team, 2019). Another type of art AI is often used for is digital art. An example of this was when a small company applied machine learning to produce different artworks with the painting style of the famous painter Fernando Amorsolo in order to commemorate him (Brunich, 2022). There is also another interesting use of AI that generates a digital version of people based on the photos they provide. Popular Filipinos like TV personality Joey Mead King and Chef Miko Aspiras, and photographer or graphic designer Samantha Valenciano shared the AI-created versions of themselves in their social media (Rodrigues, 2022). But besides imitating and combining artworks, AI has also been useful in art restoration. In 2011, a paper was written describing the process of digitally restoring Fernando Amorsolo’s painting named “Malacañang by the River” through a neural network (Palmero & Soriano, 2011). At present, Philippine artists have divided views on AI-generated art. While there are those that see AI as something that can be abused and monopolized in the art industry, there are also others that see it as a fascinating and useful product of technology (de Leon, 2022). 

-- Part 4: WHY IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ART GENERATION DISRUPTIVE [POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE] --

AI art generators are disruptive in the market due to their potential to generate art that is indiscernible from human-created art.
This has the potential to disrupt the traditional art market by making it more challenging for individuals to distinguish between art crafted by a human and art generated by a machine.
This could lead to a scenario in which the value of art is based on the quality of the art itself rather than the fact that it was created by a human.
This could potentially result in a shift in the valuation of art and create new opportunities for artists who are able to produce high-quality AI-generated art.
Let's look at the ways AI art generators can positively and negatively disrupt the art industry:

Positive Disruptions
Artificial intelligence (AI) art generators can be both seen as something useful and harmful to the art industry. 
Starting with its positive impacts, AI art generators can help in the draft or planning process of an artist. It can help conceptualize an idea in your mind, and can help you visualize it before working on the actual artwork. 
Gey (2021) argues that artificial intelligence won’t be replacing the artists themselves, but will only serve as an additional tool that can aid them in creating their artworks.
He notes that many critics see AI as something that will positively disrupt the art industry, as “it enables artists to express themselves more easily.”
Further elaborating on this viewpoint, he believes that if artists used AI, it can speed up their process of creating art and in turn, the quicker process can give them more profit in the long run.

Gey (2021) also points out another usage for AI art generators: art restoration. AI art generators can function and produce works by analyzing an incredibly large number of multimedia from their databases (Clarke, 2022).
In the field of art restoration, old artworks by famous artists can be restored in a quicker and more accurate manner. 
A notable example where AI was utilized in the restoration of a famous artwork was with Rembrandt’s “Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq” also known as “The Night Watch.”
In Escalante-De Mattei’s (2021) report on the subject matter, the museum that currently holds “The Night Watch”, The Rijksmuseum, has made multiple attempts to restore the artwork.
On their 26th attempt, they turned to artificial intelligence to help recreate the missing segments of the mutilated painting. The “restored” version made with help from AI was soon printed and varnished, and then was displayed in the museum for three months.

Negative Disruptions
With the rising popularity of accessible online artificial intelligence (AI) art generators, it has exposed more people to the idea of AI art.
Although this may be a great way to have assistance with visualizing creative ideas, other people have specifically chosen to use these art generators with ill-mannered intentions.
An app currently trending online, “Lensa AI,” has produced some eye-catching creations. With such distinct and interesting results coming from the application, many artists are wondering how and where is it getting “training” from?
Hatmaker (2022) states that the main AI generator that runs the Lensa AI app is called “Stable Diffusion.” This software has studied more than a total of 2.3 billion images.
With this huge number of media, many personal photos and artworks taken from a variety of websites have been used in the training of the AI. Whether or not they have consented to this, artists and creatives do not have the choice to have their works removed from this system.

A more specific instance that showcases the negative effects of AI art generators was when an artist named “AT” (@haruno_intro on Twitter) got their artwork stolen by a self-proclaimed AI “artist” named “Musaish.” 
Jiang (2022) further discussed this situation in an in-depth report: AT was live-streaming themselves digitally painting on Twitch, wherein Musaish simply took a screenshot of the almost-finished piece, inputted it into an AI art generator to help “finish” the artwork, and quickly posted it to their Twitter account many hours before AT was able to officially post the finished original artwork. 
Many people, along with the original artist, were soon alerted of this problem when Musaish started complaining and accusing AT of “stealing” their art, arguing that since they posted it first, AT should give them credit. 
Many Twitter users and artists got upset and angry over Musaish’s baseless accusations, and they deleted their account soon after.

The many issues with artificial intelligence (AI) art generators have made artists worried for the future of art and creative work.
These AI art generators have the power to aid people in various ways, but this usefulness is quickly overshadowed by the people using these programs with selfish and malicious intent.

-- Part 5: WHAT FIELD/MARKET IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ART GENERATION DISRUPTING --

Although, some ad agencies do benefit from these art generators as cost-effective and time-saving tools when conceptualizing and making mood boards for their clients, instead of gathering stock images from search engines for hours (Bonila, 2022).
These industries (i.e. design, entertainment, advertising), however, also have another issue to keep in mind when using AI generators and that is the demographic representation (e.g. gender, race, age) found in resulting images.
As images and art are manually fed and trained into the AI system based on keywords, critics are concerned that generated art would reflect human bias and stereotypes (Wong, 2022).
Furthermore, AI art generators could also indirectly affect industries related to the underlying technology, such as the computer hardware and software industries, similar to those involved in developing and training AI systems, such as academia and research institutions.

-- Part 6: CONCLUSION [ALTERNATIVES?] --
Art generators are disruptive, and their practical and long-term ramifications are yet to be seen. Regardless of its negative or positive effects, A.I. Art is now part of our modern digital world, and as citizens of this world, it is important to recognize that changes are happening. It is essential to learn how to take advantage of these tools, but not at the cost of endangering the people’s livelihood. As the world adjusts its rules to cater A.I. art, we can meanwhile support our local artists whenever we can. Some of them are:
- Cazzyflores
- 88valentine
- Rcehb.art
- Cold.crest
- Beamatuts_artdump
